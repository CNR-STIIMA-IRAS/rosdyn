ROSdyn implements a fully automated procedure able to calibrate the robot dynamics model. 

It is integrated with MoveIt! to automatically compute, simulate, and execute identification trajectory. The result is stored in a URDF file.




## Build/Installation 

The software can be installed with the following [rosinstall file](rosdyn.rosinstall). 


## Build Status

## List of packages

> *rosdyn_core*: Dynamics header library based on Eigen. With respect to KDL, it has two advantages: it is faster and it allows to compute model regressor.

> *rosdyn_identification*: Nodelet-based library for trajectory generation and for model calibration.

> *rosdyn_gui*: RViz front-end plugin

> *rosdyn_identification_msgs*: Action definition for generating identification trajectory and estimating model.

## Usage

__ coming soon! __
