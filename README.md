ROSdyn implements a fully automated procedure able to calibrate the robot dynamics model.

It is integrated with MoveIt! to automatically compute, simulate, and execute identification trajectory. The result is stored in a URDF file.

## Build/Installation

The software can be installed with the following [rosinstall file](rosdyn.rosinstall).

Travis CI Kinetic Build: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CNR-STIIMA-IRAS/rosdyn.svg?branch=melodic-devel)](https://travis-ci.org/CNR-STIIMA-IRAS/rosdyn)


__IMPORTANT__ rosdyn_identification has been moved [here](https://github.com/CNR-STIIMA-IRAS/rosdyn_identification).

## List of packages

### **rosdyn_core** [see README](rosdyn_core/README.md):
Dynamics header library based on Eigen. With respect to KDL, it has two advantages: it is faster and it allow computing model regressor.


An example of usage can be found [here](rosdyn_core/test/rosdyn_speed_test.cpp)

The following list shows the computation times for a 6DOF robot on a laptop Asus PU551J with Ubuntu 16.04 (Release build,  average on 10000 trials).

** computation time in microseconds: **

> pose                                            =  0.75970 [us]

> pose + jacobian                                       =  1.06562 [us]
