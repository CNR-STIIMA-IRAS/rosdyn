ROSdyn implements a fully automated procedure able to calibrate the robot dynamics model. 

It is integrated with MoveIt! to automatically compute, simulate, and execute identification trajectory. The result is stored in a URDF file.

## Build/Installation 

The software can be installed with the following [rosinstall file](rosdyn.rosinstall). 

Travis CI Kinetic Build: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CNR-STIIMA-IRAS/rosdyn.svg?branch=melodic-devel)](https://travis-ci.org/CNR-STIIMA-IRAS/rosdyn)


## List of packages

### **rosdyn_core**:
Dynamics header library based on Eigen. With respect to KDL, it has two advantages: it is faster and it allows to compute model regressor. 

An example of usage can be found [here](rosdyn_core/test/rosdyn_speed_test.cpp)

The following list shows the computation times for a 6DOF robot on a laptop Asus PU551J with Ubuntu 16.04 (Release build,  average on 10000 trials).

## Usage

In order to use RosDyn identification tools, you need to do the following preliminary steps:

> Create a moveit package (see <a href="http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html">tutorial</a>)

> Define the list of parameters in **required parameters** section

> in RViz: 

>> click on *Panels* tag, then *add new panel*, select *IdentificationGui*

>> check on *Add* in the Display widgets, addd a *Trajectory* visualization

>> In the *Trajectory* visualization, select as Trajectory topic */rosdyn/simulated_trajectory*

>> be sure that the MoveIt! scene contains all the ostacles!

Now you are ready to generate a trajectory by clicking of *1) Generate Trajectory*, it will required seconds or minutes depending on the desired trajectory duration

You can visualize the obtained trajectory by clicking on *2) Simulate Trajectory*. With the *Trajectory* visualization you can rerun the simulation or check a spefic part of the trajectory

You can reiterated the trajectory generation if you are not satisfied of the obtained results.

Once you are ready, click on *3) Execute trajectory* to execute the trajectory on real robot. Survey the robotic cell!! Tip: if your robot allows to slow down the trajectory execution, execute the trajectory once with the reduced velocity and once with the normal velocity.

Now you are ready to estimate the model by clicking the *4) Estimate model*, a pop-up window show the model estimation accuracy (TBD).

You can save the model by clicking *Save Model*. A urdf file and a yaml file will be created in /home/$USER/.ros folder.

With the *Advanced settings*, you can change the trajectory generation parameters, as well as the filtering bandwidth and the Friction model.
